# Interesting Scripts
This is a repository for storing interesting scripts that I created to learn and test different scripting languages.

Everyone is free to fork and copy the source code if they find it useful.

However, no issues or pull requests will be worked on because this is a simple personal archive for storing scripts that I find.
